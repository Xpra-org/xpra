Parti project README
====================

Hi, welcome to Parti.  The overall goal of this project is to create a
modern, tabbing/tiling window manager.  It got a little distracted, so
now there are actually three conceptually-independent projects in this
tree:

wimpiggy: A library for writing window managers, used by both of the
  next two items.

parti: The above-mentioned window manager, currently in
  proof-of-concept form.

xpra: "X Persistent Remote Applications" -- think 'screen for X'.
  Currently beta status.

See the <project>.README for more details about each.
