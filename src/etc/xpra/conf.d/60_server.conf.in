# Server Options:

# Directory for server log files:
#log-dir = /var/run/user/$UID
#log-dir = ~/.xpra
#log-dir = /tmp
log-dir = %(log_dir)s

# Log file:
log-file = $DISPLAY.log

# Environment variables for children started
# with 'start-child' or 'start':
# (can be specified multiple times)
#start-env = HOME=/home/alt
#start-env = GDK_DEBUG=dnd
%(start_env)s

# Commands to start by default
#  (may be specified more than once):
# examples:
#start-child = /usr/bin/xterm
#start-child = /usr/bin/xeyes
#start=/bin/true
#
# Xsession can take care of initializing dbus, keyring-daemon,
# gpg-agent or whatever else might be usually started together with X
#start = /etc/X11/Xsession true
# Or you can specify individual actions:
#xrdb -merge /etc/X11/Xresources
#xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
#
# The difference between start and start-child is only relevant
# when using exit-with-children.
# This causes the server to terminate when the last child has exited:
exit-with-children = no

# Commands to start immediately after the first client has connected:
# (see above for the start vs start-child distinction)
#start-after-connect = touch ~/.xpra/connect
#start-child-after-connect = xterm

# Commands to every time a client connects:
# (see above for the start vs start-child distinction)
#start-on-connect = touch ~/.xpra/login
#start-child-on-connect = xterm

# Start a dbus-daemon:
# dbus-launch =
# dbus-launch = /usr/bin/dbus-launch --close-stderr
dbus-launch = dbus-launch --close-stderr

# Start a dbus server which can be used to interact with the server process:
#dbus-control = no
dbus-control = %(dbus_control)s

# Forward client dbus rpc requests:
# (requires client configuration)
#dbus-proxy = no
dbus-proxy = %(dbus_proxy)s

# A wrapper for executing all sub-commands:
# exec-wrapper = vglrun --
# exec-wrapper = vglrun -d :1 --

# Allows clients to start new commands in the server context:
#start-new-commands = yes
start-new-commands = no

# Start a pulseaudio server with each session:
pulseaudio = %(pulseaudio)s

# pulseaudio server start command:
pulseaudio-command = %(pulseaudio_command)s

# commands used to configure the pulseaudio server:
# pactl set-source-volume SomeSource 20%%
%(pulseaudio_configure_commands)s


# Systemd specific options:
# Wrap server start commands with systemd-run:
#systemd-run = no
#systemd-run = auto
systemd-run = %(systemd_run)s

# Command line arguments passed to systemd-run:
#systemd-run-args = -p MemoryAccounting=true -p MemoryHigh=384M -p MemoryLimit=512M
#systemd-run-args = -p CPUAccounting=true -p CPUQuota=25%%
